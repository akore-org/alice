# ALICE DI

Highly opinionated kotlin DI library

## Features

- Simple/Compact API
- Android Compose / ViewModel support out of the box
- Introspectable dependency tree

## What is inside

Inside this library actually does not implement DI container on its own,
but delegates everything to [Koin](https://insert-koin.io).
